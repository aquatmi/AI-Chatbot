# Artificial Intelligence ChatBot

Module: Artificial Intelligence

Brief: Produce ChatBot with rule-based and similarity based responses, as well as a sequence to sequence network, deep learning network, image classification component and toy world reasoning system

Language: Python

Grade: 2.1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I did: 

Produced Chatbot with theme around road safety and laws.

Added set rules for responses about common questions, eg speed limits.

provided corpus for bot to search through for responses for unknown questions.

Produced Road-Sign classification module, trained with corpus off Kaggle.

developed basic toy world reasoning system.

added transformer to help bot try and understand and respond to unknown questions, which werent sufficiently similar to corpus information

used evolutionary algorithms to train bot to play cartpole from openAI Gym

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I would like to add post-marking

I dont know if i would add much to this after fixing up issues but I would like to do more evolutionary algorithms

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
To-Do Bug Fixes:

fix transformer so it actually responds in english and not gibberish

retry image classification to enable more images to work, basically required close up images of only the sign to accurately identify at the moment
